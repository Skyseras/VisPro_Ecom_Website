Visionary Crofting VisPro is an Ecommerce website specializes in the sale of agricultural products.


## The sales process is made up of two main stages:

### The first stage is described as follows:

A customer wishes to place an order. A customer is characterized by his email, his password, his phone, and a list of orders. An order is defined by its reference, its date, its total price and a list of item orders. An item order is determined by its reference, the reference of the desired product, the price and the quantity.


### The second step is specified by the following sequence:

The company wishes to manage its stock of products. A product is defined by its reference, its initial price, its description, its category, its full name and its quantity. The product is in stock. 

A stock is characterized by its name, its address, a telephone, an email and a password for the manager of the stock. In the case of a product out of stock, the company calls on a supplier to order the products in question. 

A call for tenders is characterized by its reference, the product in question, the stock which triggered this tender, and the status of this tender (open, validated or closed). A supplier is characterized by his name, his email, his telephone and a password.


Your application must automate the backend part of the entire sales procedure in addition to the various multi-criteria filters for each user:

Customer: filter the orders made. Stock manager: filter calls for tenders as well as existing products in stock. Supplier: filter calls for tenders.

You are led to the discovery of spring MVC to familiarize yourself with the configuration that Springboot was automating in the previous brief, while respecting the following standards:

• Create a work plan for the application with the different tasks using JIRA. 

• Perform a system analysis using UML 

• Create a Java/SpringMvc/JSP or Jsf Web application respecting the managements mentioned above 

• Manage your data with a Mysql or PostgreSql database
